# Jeopardy - Turing Mod 2 FE Project
A site for users to play Space Jeopardy with their friends! Pick clues based on their values, answer correctly to increase user's score and possibly pick randomly placed Daily Doubles for a chance to wager a bet. All users wager bets and try to answer the Final Jeopardy clue in hopes to have the highest score and be declared the winner!

### Set-Up Front-End:
Clone this repo

Run npm install in your terminal


### Test Driven Development:
Jeopardy uses Mocha and Chai for testing

Run with npm test from the associated root directory


### Background / About:
For this project we leveraged object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to build the game, Space Jeopardy from scratch. Space Jeopardy implements array prototype methods that iterate/mutate a data-set. Space jeopardy also leverages the principles of test-driven-development.

Space Jeopardy consists of three rounds with three players. Each player can submit their names and start the game! During game play, each player takes a turn choosing a clue based on its value and then submits answer. There are also Daily Dubles in which the player also submits a wager before submitting their answer. Scores increment/decrement based on whether the clue is answered correctly. The Final Round provides a category and allows each player to submit a wager and their final guess. The player with the highest score is declared the winner.
