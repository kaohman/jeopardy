# Jeopardy - Turing Mod 2 FE Project
A site for users to play Space Jeopardy with their friends! Pick clues based on their values, answer correctly to increase user's score and possibly pick randomly placed Daily Doubles for a chance to wager a bet. All users wager bets and try to answer the Final Jeopardy clue in hopes to have the highest score and be declared the winner!
