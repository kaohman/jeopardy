### Set-Up Front-End:
Clone this repo

Run npm install in your terminal


### Background / About:
For this project we leveraged object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to build the game, Space Jeopardy from scratch. Space Jeopardy implements array prototype methods that iterate/mutate a data-set. Space Jeopardy also leverages the principles of test-driven-development.

Space Jeopardy consists of three rounds with three players. Each player can submit their names and start the game! During game play, each player takes a turn choosing a clue based on its value and then submits answer. There are also Daily Doubles in which the player also submits a wager before submitting their answer. Scores increment/decrement based on whether the clue is answered correctly. The Final Round provides a category and allows each player to submit a wager and their final guess. The player with the highest score is declared the winner. 


### Primary Technologies Used:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript


### Test Driven Development:
Jeopardy uses Mocha and Chai for testing

Run with npm test from the associated root directory


### Enhancements:
Additional enhancements will include:
1. Set default player names
2. Displaying correct answer if player answer is incorrect in Round 1 & 2
3. More animation
